## Privacy Policy

Thank you for using the **SubFlow** app. By using this app, you agree to the terms outlined in this Privacy Policy.

---

### **Requested Permissions**

**SubFlow** requires the following permissions:

- **Notifications**:  
  Used to remind you of upcoming subscription renewals in advance. Notifications are used *exclusively* for this purpose.

- **Biometrics (Face ID/Touch ID)**:  
  If you choose to use the app lock, SubFlow may ask for permission to unlock the app using Face ID or Touch ID.  
  The app uses the `LocalAuthentication` framework (available for supported devices) to authenticate with biometrics, but **does not have access** to your biometric data, which is stored on the device and managed entirely by the operating system.  
  These permissions are not used for any other purpose.

---

### **Data Collection and Storage**

- **No Personal Data Collection**:  
  SubFlow does not collect any personal data from users and does not display advertisements.

- **Purchase Verification**:  
  SubFlow may communicate with Apple servers or other payment services to verify your purchase.

- **iCloud Backup**:  
  Data is stored in a private CloudKit container. The developer does **not** have access to this data.

---

### **Data Security**

SubFlow implements security measures to ensure the protection of data stored in the app and associated services, such as iCloud.  
However, we recommend that users keep their device security settings up to date for added protection.

---

### **Your Rights**

You have the right to control how your information is stored and used.  
You can manage notification permissions at any time through the app settings.

---

### **Changes to this Policy**

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time.  
We will inform users of important changes through in-app notifications or other appropriate means.
